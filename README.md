# Crypto-Scraping
These are scripts to get historic values of cryptocurrencies

cryptoHoldValues calculates value change between given dates

saleValue calculates dollar value of a sale on a single date

You can run it in terminal as it is, just change the coins and amounts to search in the scripts. Both export to csv. If you prefer to print to terminal there are lines to do so, just uncomment them.

I plan to create a UI with a datepicker and space to select coin(s) in the future
