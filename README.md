# Crypto-Scraping
These are scripts to get historic values of cryptocurrencies
1 script calculates value change between given dates
1 script calculates dollar value of a sale on a single date

You can run it in terminal as it is, just change the coins and amounts to search in the scripts.
I plan to create a UI with a datepicker and space to select coin(s) in the future
